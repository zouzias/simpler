"""dummy_task: verify dep-only tasks block consumers and never run a kernel.

The orchestration submits one of three scenes, controlled by params["case"]:

  case=1 (single dummy via tensormap INOUT):
    producer writes X[0]=42.0 -> dummy_T INOUTs X -> consumer copies X to Y.
    Y[0] must equal 42.0. If dummy somehow ran a kernel it would zero or
    corrupt the buffer; the value 42.0 in Y proves both ordering and the
    no-op nature of dummy_task.

  case=2 (long dummy chain):
    Same as case 1, but with LONG_CHAIN_DUMMIES dummies between producer
    and consumer. Looks after the dummy_ready_queue + dispatch-loop drain
    when several dummies sit on the critical path back-to-back.

  case=3 (explicit set_dependencies barrier):
    Two independent producers (writing X and W); a dummy_T uses
    set_dependencies({A, B}, 2) as a many-to-one barrier; the consumer
    set_dependencies({dummy}, 1) and reads X. Verifies dummy_task
    participates in explicit_dep wiring.
