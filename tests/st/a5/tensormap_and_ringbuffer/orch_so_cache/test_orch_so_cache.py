"""End-to-end coverage for the orchestration SO host-side cache.

The host hashes the orchestration SO's GNU Build-ID, skips re-uploading bytes
that already live on device, and tells AICPU to reuse the cached `dlopen`
handle. The framework reuses one `Worker` (and therefore one `DeviceRunner`)
across cases inside a `SceneTestCase`, so running multiple cases against the
same `CALLABLE` exercises the cache-hit path on every case after the first.

This test deliberately:
  - Reuses the vector_example orchestration & AIV kernels (no new C++ to maintain).
  - Spans three cases with different (a, b) inputs — proves cache hit doesn't
    leak any per-run state across iterations.
  - Uses the same tensor size (128*128) across all cases because the AIV
    kernels have hardcoded tile shapes and do not accept a runtime size.
  - Runs on both sim and hardware (sim DeviceRunner uses the same code path,
    just with `mem_alloc_` returning host memory).

Verification is purely outcome-based: every case must produce the correct
result. A regression in cache logic (stale handle, wrong device buffer,
missing dlopen on first run) shows up as wrong output or a runtime failure.
