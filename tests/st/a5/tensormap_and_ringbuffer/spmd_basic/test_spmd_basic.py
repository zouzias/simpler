"""SPMD basic context accessors: single MIX task verifying block_idx, block_num, sub_block_id.

Submits one MIX task (AIC + AIV0 + AIV1) with block_dim=1.
Each subtask writes its SPMD context at a sub_block_id-based offset.

Output layout (float32[48], 3 cache lines):
  [0..15]  = AIC  slot: [block_idx, block_num, pad x14]
  [16..31] = AIV0 slot: [block_idx, block_num, sub_block_id=0, pad x13]
  [32..47] = AIV1 slot: [block_idx, block_num, sub_block_id=1, pad x13]
