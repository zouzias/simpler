/**
 * CallConfig — per-NEXT_LEVEL-task config. Carries execution knobs
 * (block_dim, aicpu_thread_num) plus the four parallel diagnostics
 * sub-features under the profiling umbrella: `enable_l2_swimlane` (swimlane),
 * `enable_dump_tensor`, `enable_pmu`, and `enable_dep_gen`.
 *
 * Lives here (rather than chip_worker.h) so distributed task slot state
 * can store it directly without pulling in the full ChipWorker header
 * (which depends on types.h).
 *
 * Wire-compatible POD — packed and laid out so that one memcpy moves the
 * whole struct between the parent and the forked child via the shared-memory
 * mailbox. `bool` fields are stored as int32 to keep the layout deterministic
 * across compilers (sizeof(bool) is implementation-defined).
 *
 * `output_prefix` is a NUL-terminated directory path under which all
 * diagnostic artifacts (l2_perf_records.json / tensor_dump/ / pmu.csv /
 * submit_trace.bin) are written. The caller is responsible for filling it
 * whenever any diagnostic flag is enabled — `validate()` enforces this
 * contract at every submit/run entry point so the runtime never has to
 * invent a path.
