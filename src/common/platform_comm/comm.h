/**
 * Backend-neutral distributed communication C API.
 *
 * Provides six primitives for multi-rank communication: init, allocate
 * shared windows, query local window base, query window size, barrier,
 * and destroy.
 *
 * Implementations:
 *   onboard/host/comm_hccl.cpp — HCCL backend (links CANN hccl/hccl_fwk)
 *   sim/host/comm_sim.cpp      — malloc-based simulation
 *
 * All functions are compiled into libhost_runtime.so. The linker selects
 * the implementation at build time (onboard vs sim), with no runtime
 * dispatch or virtual functions.
