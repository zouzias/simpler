/**
 * PTO Runtime C API — canonical header
 *
 * Declares all C-linkage functions exported by the host runtime .so.
 * Both the ChipWorker (consumer, resolves public symbols via dlsym) and the
 * platform implementations (producers, define all symbols) include this file.
 *
 * Public API — resolved by ChipWorker via dlsym (every host_runtime.so must
 * export ALL of these; runtimes without a real backend ship not-supported
 * stubs rather than omitting symbols, so ChipWorker can dlsym the full set
 * unconditionally without per-symbol probing):
 *   - lifecycle:    create_device_context, destroy_device_context,
 *                   simpler_init, finalize_device
 *   - sizing:       get_runtime_size
 *   - device-mem:   device_malloc_ctx, device_free_ctx,
 *                   copy_to_device_ctx, copy_from_device_ctx
 *   - prepared run: prepare_callable, run_prepared, unregister_callable,
 *                   get_aicpu_dlopen_count, get_host_dlopen_count
 *   - ACL/stream:   ensure_acl_ready_ctx, create_comm_stream_ctx,
 *                   destroy_comm_stream_ctx
 *   - comm:         comm_init, comm_alloc_windows, comm_get_local_window_base,
 *                   comm_get_window_size, comm_barrier, comm_destroy
 *
 * Memory management: caller allocates a buffer of get_runtime_size() bytes
 * and passes it to run_prepared(). Error codes: 0 = success, negative = error.

/**
 * One-shot platform-side init. Called once by ChipWorker::init() right
 * after dlopen, before any other entry. Three responsibilities, in order:
 *
 *   1. (Onboard only) Sync CANN dlog with HostLogger::get_instance().level()
 *      via dlog_setlevel(-1, level, 0), unless ASCEND_GLOBAL_LOG_LEVEL was
 *      externally configured, in which case CANN keeps the user's choice.
 *      This must run before step 2 because CANN snapshots the device-side
 *      log session's level at context-open time (rtSetDevice); a later
 *      dlog_setlevel would not re-level the already-opened device session.
 *      The log level itself is owned by libsimpler_log.so (seeded earlier
 *      by simpler_log_init); it never travels through this ABI.
 *
 *   2. Attach the calling thread to `device_id` (rtSetDevice on onboard,
 *      pto_cpu_sim_bind_device + pto_cpu_sim_acquire_device on sim) and
 *      record the device id on the DeviceRunner so subsequent device-ops
 *      can re-attach their own caller threads idempotently.
 *
 *   3. Take ownership of the AICPU + AICore executor binaries (copied into
 *      DeviceRunner-owned vectors). All subsequent prepare_callable /
 *      run_prepared invocations reuse this resident pair — no binary bytes
 *      cross the C ABI on per-run paths.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, negative on attach failure.
