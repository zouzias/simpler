/**
 * @file cpu_sim_context.h
 * @brief Per-device CPU simulation context for CANN intrinsic emulation
 *
 * Each simulated device gets an isolated context (pipe shared state)
 * so multiple ChipWorkers can run concurrently without interference.
 *
 * All pto_sim_* functions operate on the context bound to the calling
 * thread's device_id (set via pto_cpu_sim_bind_device).
 *
 * Invariant: each simulated device_id has a single owner ChipWorker per
 * process. The owner calls acquire_device() inside DeviceRunner's
 * attach_current_thread() (driven by ChipWorker::init) and release_device()
 * at finalize_device() time, after all worker threads for that device
 * have been joined. Concurrent access from multiple ChipWorkers to the
 * same device_id is undefined behavior.
