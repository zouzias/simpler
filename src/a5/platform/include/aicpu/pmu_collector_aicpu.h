/**
 * @file pmu_collector_aicpu.h
 * @brief AICPU-side PMU collection interface (a5)
 *
 * Lifecycle (called from aicpu_executor.cpp):
 *   pmu_aicpu_init()              — resolve per-core PMU MMIO bases + buffer
 *                                   pointers, program events, start counters,
 *                                   pop initial PmuBuffers from free_queues,
 *                                   and cache the per-core stable
 *                                   PmuAicoreRing pointer.
 *                                   Profiling state never goes through Handshake.
 *   [task loop]
 *     pmu_aicpu_complete_record()     — copy the dual-issue slot AICore wrote
 *                                   into PmuBuffer::records[count], filling
 *                                   func_id + core_type. Switches buffer
 *                                   when full.
 *   pmu_aicpu_flush_buffers()     — per-thread: flush each of this thread's
 *                                   non-empty PmuBuffers to the ready_queue
 *                                   (mirrors a2a3 pmu_aicpu_flush_buffers)
 *   pmu_aicpu_finalize()          — per-thread: restore CTRL registers.

 *   - Resolve the PMU MMIO base from physical_core_ids[i] via the platform's
 *     register-base table (`get_platform_regs()`).
 *   - Program event selectors (PMU_CNT0_IDX..CNT9_IDX).
 *   - Start counters (set PMU_CTRL_0 and PMU_CTRL_1).
 *   - Pop an initial PmuBuffer from the per-core free_queue.
 *   - Cache the per-core stable PmuAicoreRing pointer (host-published into
 *     PmuBufferState::aicore_ring_ptr at SHM init time) so the PMU
 *     complete-path can read AICore-written slots without touching SHM.
 *
 * AICore resolves its own MMIO base independently at kernel entry from the
 * same `regs` table via `regs[get_physical_core_id()]`, so this init does
 * **not** need to publish a separate per-core table for AICore.
 *
 * On sim (or when a core has no PMU reg addr), the core is skipped for MMIO
 * programming. AICore no-ops the read if its resolved reg_base is 0.
 *
 * Profiling state lives outside Handshake — this function does **not**
 * touch any Handshake field.
