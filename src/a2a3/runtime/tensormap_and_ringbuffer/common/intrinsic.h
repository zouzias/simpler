/**
 * @file intrinsic.h
 * @brief SPMD execution context for AICore user kernels
 *
 * Topology data exposed to user kernels has two distinct lifetimes:
 *
 *   1. Global topology (per-core, fixed after runtime init):
 *      - sub_block_id : identifies the AIV lane within a cluster
 *        (0 = AIV0/left, 1 = AIV1/right).  Initialized once at runtime
 *        startup based on each core's cluster position; never changes.
 *        Only meaningful for AIV kernels in MIX tasks.
 *
 *   2. Local per-dispatch context (changes each dispatch):
 *      - block_idx : which logical block the current worker is executing
 *      - block_num : total number of blocks in this task (= block_dim)
 *      Written by build_payload() before each dispatch.
 *
 * Both categories are injected via two pointer slots appended at the tail
 * of the kernel args[] array:
 *
 *   args layout:
 *     [0 .. tensor_count-1]                 = tensor GM pointers
 *     [tensor_count .. +scalar_count-1]     = scalar values
 *     ...
 *     [SPMD_LOCAL_CONTEXT_INDEX]            = (uint64_t)&LocalContext   (per-dispatch)
 *     [SPMD_GLOBAL_CONTEXT_INDEX]           = (uint64_t)&GlobalContext  (per-core)
 *
 * The suffix positions are compile-time constants and do not depend on the
 * runtime tensor_count or scalar_count.
 *
 * Include this header in AICore kernel source files to use the Get* accessors.
 * Do NOT depend on the raw index constants; always use the accessor functions.
 *
 * On CCEC (real hardware), __gm__ and __aicore__ must be defined before
 * including this header (e.g. via <pto/pto-inst.hpp> or manual #define).
 * The #ifndef guards below provide fallbacks for non-kernel builds
 * (AICPU, HOST) where these qualifiers are not needed.
