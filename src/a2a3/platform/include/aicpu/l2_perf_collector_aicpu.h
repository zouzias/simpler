 * validates the task_id match, fills all AICPU-side fields, commits into
 * the current records buffer, and rotates the records buffer internally
 * once it fills up. Callers must pre-extract fanout into a plain uint64_t
 * array (platform layer cannot depend on runtime linked-list types).
 *
 * Per-core counter accounting:
 *   total_record_count++       — every commit attempt (success or failure)
 *   dropped_record_count++     — capacity-driven drop (no free buffer / queue
 *                                full); actionable via

 *                                completion-before-dispatch invariant says
 *                                this must never happen; if it does, it is a
