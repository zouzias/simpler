"""L2 Worker memory-control demo — malloc / copy_to / copy_from / free, no kernels.

This example exercises the four host<->device memory primitives on the
``Worker`` API in isolation, without ever calling ``worker.run()``:

  * ``worker.malloc(nbytes)``   — allocate device memory, returns uint64 ptr
  * ``worker.copy_to(dst, src, n)`` — H2D byte copy
  * ``worker.copy_from(dst, src, n)`` — D2H byte copy
  * ``worker.free(ptr)``        — release device memory

Why a standalone example for these? On real hardware (a2a3 / a5 onboard) the
CANN device context is per-thread, so ``rtMalloc`` only succeeds on a thread
that previously executed ``rtSetDevice``. ``Worker.init(...)`` is now the
single point that performs that bind for the Python caller thread (folded
down from the previous explicit ``ChipWorker::set_device``). If that path
breaks, this example fails at the first ``worker.malloc`` with CANN error
107002. ``vector_add`` happens to mask such a bug because its first malloc
lands on the same thread that ``run()`` later attaches; this example doesn't
``run`` at all, so it's a focused regression check for the standalone alloc
path.

Run:
    python examples/workers/l2/worker_malloc/main.py -p a2a3sim -d 0
    python examples/workers/l2/worker_malloc/main.py -p a2a3   -d 0
